# Daily::RoomProperties

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **nbf** | **Integer** | \&quot;Not before\&quot;. This is a [unix timestamp](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20822821/what-is-a-unix-timestamp-and-why-use-it) (seconds since the epoch.) Users cannot join a meeting in this room before this time. | [optional] |
| **exp** | **Integer** | \&quot;Expires\&quot;. This is a unix timestamp (seconds since the epoch.) Users cannot join a meeting in this room after this time.  More resources: - [Add advanced security to video chats with the Daily API](https://www.daily.co/blog/add-advanced-security-features-to-video-chats-with-the-daily-api/) | [optional] |
| **max_participants** | **Integer** | How many people are allowed in a room at the same time.  ⚠️ [Contact us](https://www.daily.co/contact) if you need to set the limit above 200. | [optional][default to 200] |
| **enable_people_ui** | **Boolean** | Determines if [Daily Prebuilt](/guides/products/prebuilt) displays the People UI. When set to true, a People button in the call tray reveals a People tab in the call sidebar. The tab lists all participants, and next to each name indicates audio status and an option to pin the participant. When &#x60;enable_people_ui&#x60; is set to false, the button and tab are hidden.  ⚠️ Has no effect on custom calls built on the Daily [call object](/guides/products/call-object). | [optional] |
| **enable_pip_ui** | **Boolean** | Sets whether the room can use [Daily Prebuilt](https://www.daily.co/prebuilt)&#39;s Picture in Picture controls. When set to &#x60;true&#x60;, an additional button will be available in Daily Prebuilt&#39;s UI to toggle the Picture in Picture feature.  ⚠️ This flag only applies to Daily Prebuilt. It has no effect when building custom video applications with the Daily call object. | [optional] |
| **enable_emoji_reactions** | **Boolean** | Determines if [Daily Prebuilt](https://www.daily.co/prebuilt) displays the Emoji Reactions UI. When set to &#x60;true&#x60;, a Reactions button appears in the call tray. This button allows users to select and send a reaction into the call. When set to &#x60;false&#x60;, the Reactions button is hidden and the feature is disabled.  Usage: This feature is a good fit for meetings when a host or presenter would benefit from receiving nonverbal cues from the audience. It&#39;s also great to keep meetings fun.  ⚠️ This flag only applies to Daily Prebuilt. It has no effect when building custom video applications with the Daily call object. | [optional] |
| **enable_hand_raising** | **Boolean** | Sets whether the participants in the room can use [Daily Prebuilt](https://www.daily.co/prebuilt)&#39;s hand raising controls. When set to &#x60;true&#x60;, an additional button will be available in Daily Prebuilt&#39;s UI to toggle a hand raise.  ⚠️ This flag only applies to Daily Prebuilt. It has no effect when building custom video applications with the Daily call object. | [optional] |
| **enable_prejoin_ui** | **Boolean** | Determines whether participants enter a waiting room with a camera, mic, and browser check before joining a call.  ⚠️ You must be using [Daily Prebuilt](https://daily.co/prebuilt) to use &#x60;enable_prejoin_ui&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **enable_network_ui** | **Boolean** | Determines whether the network button, and the network panel it reveals on click, appears in this room.  ⚠️ You must be using [Daily Prebuilt](https://daily.co/prebuilt) to use &#x60;enable_network_ui&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **enable_noise_cancellation_ui** | **Boolean** | Determines whether Daily Prebuilt displays noise cancellation controls. When set to &#x60;true&#x60;, a participant can enable microphone noise cancellation during a Daily Prebuilt call. ⚠️ This flag only applies to [Daily Prebuilt](https://daily.co/prebuilt). It has no effect when building custom video applications with the Daily call object. To learn more about adding noise cancellation to a custom application, see the [&#x60;updateInputSettings()&#x60; docs](/reference/daily-js/instance-methods/update-input-settings). | [optional] |
| **enable_breakout_rooms** | **Boolean** | Sets whether [Daily Prebuilt](https://www.daily.co/prebuilt)’s breakout rooms feature is enabled. When set to &#x60;true&#x60;, an owner in a Prebuilt call can create breakout rooms to divide participants into smaller, private groups.   ⚠️ You must be using [Daily Prebuilt](https://daily.co/blog/daily-prebuilt-video-chat) to use &#x60;enable_breakout_rooms&#x60;.  ⚠️ This property is in beta. | [optional] |
| **enable_knocking** | **Boolean** | Turns on a lobby experience for private rooms. A participant without a corresponding [meeting token](/reference/rest-api/meeting-tokens/config) can request to be admitted to the meeting with a \&quot;knock\&quot;, and wait for the meeting owner to admit them. | [optional] |
| **enable_screenshare** | **Boolean** | Sets whether users in a room can screen share during a session. This property cannot be changed after a session starts. For dynamic control over permissions, use the [&#x60;updateParticipant()&#x60;](/reference/daily-js/instance-methods/update-participant#permissions) method to control user permissions. | [optional][default to true] |
| **enable_video_processing_ui** | **Boolean** | Determines whether Daily Prebuilt displays background blur controls. When set to &#x60;true&#x60;, a participant can enable blur during a Daily Prebuilt call.  ⚠️ This flag only applies to Daily Prebuilt. It has no effect when building custom video applications with the Daily call object. | [optional][default to true] |
| **enable_chat** | **Boolean** | This property is one of [multiple ways to add chat to Daily video calls](https://www.daily.co/blog/three-ways-to-add-chat-to-your-video-calls-with-the-daily-api/). | [optional][default to false] |
| **start_video_off** | **Boolean** | Disable the default behavior of automatically turning on a participant&#39;s camera on a direct &#x60;join()&#x60; (i.e. without &#x60;startCamera()&#x60; first). | [optional][default to false] |
| **start_audio_off** | **Boolean** | Disable the default behavior of automatically turning on a participant&#39;s microphone on a direct &#x60;join()&#x60; (i.e. without &#x60;startCamera()&#x60; first). | [optional][default to false] |
| **owner_only_broadcast** | **Boolean** | In Daily Prebuilt, only the meeting owners will be able to turn on camera, unmute mic, and share screen.  See [setting up calls](https://docs.daily.co/docs/setting-up-calls). | [optional][default to false] |
| **enable_recording** | **String** | Jump to [recording docs](/reference/rest-api/recordings). | [optional][default to &#39;&lt;not set&gt;&#39;] |
| **eject_at_room_exp** | **Boolean** | If there&#39;s a meeting going on at room &#x60;exp&#x60; time, end the meeting by kicking everyone out. This behavior can be overridden by setting &#x60;eject&#x60; properties of a [meeting token](/reference/rest-api/meeting-tokens). | [optional][default to false] |
| **eject_after_elapsed** | **Integer** | Eject a meeting participant this many seconds after the participant joins the meeting. You can use this is a default length limit to prevent long meetings. This can be overridden by setting &#x60;eject&#x60; properties of a [meeting token](/reference/rest-api/meeting-tokens). | [optional] |
| **enable_advanced_chat** | **Boolean** | Property that gives end users a richer chat experience. This includes:  * Emoji reactions to chat messages * Emoji picker in the chat input form * Ability to send a Giphy chat message  ⚠️ This flag only applies to Daily Prebuilt. It has no effect when building custom video applications with the Daily call object. | [optional][default to false] |
| **enable_hidden_participants** | **Boolean** | When enabled, non-owner users join a meeting with a hidden presence, meaning they won&#39;t appear as a named participant in the meeting and have no [participant events](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/participant-events) associated to them. Additionally, these participants can _only_ receive media tracks from owner participants.  Hidden participants can be tracked using the [&#x60;participantCounts()&#x60;](/reference/daily-js/instance-methods/participant-counts) method. Hidden participants do _not_ have entries in the [&#x60;participants()&#x60;](/reference/daily-js/instance-methods/participants) method return value.  When used with [Daily Prebuilt](/guides/products/prebuilt), hidden participants are included in the participant count available in the UI; however, are _not_ included in the People panel and can only read chat messages.  This property should be used to support hosting large meetings. See our [guide on interactive live streaming](/guides/scaling-calls/interactive-live-streaming-rtmp-output#interactive-live-streaming-up-to-100-000-participants) for additional instruction. | [optional][default to false] |
| **enable_mesh_sfu** | **Boolean** | Configures a room to use multiple SFUs for a call&#39;s media. This feature enables calls to scale to large sizes and to reduce latency between participants. It is recommended specifically for interactive live streaming.  See our [guide for interactive live streaming](/guides/scaling-calls/interactive-live-streaming-rtmp-output#daily-prebuilt-configurations-to-support-100-000-participants) for additional instruction. | [optional] |
| **sfu_switchover** | **Float** | Dictates the participant count after which room topology automatically switches from Peer-to-Peer (P2P) to Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) mode, or vice versa.  For example, if &#x60;sfu_switchover&#x60; is set to &#x60;3&#x60; and the current network topology is P2P, the topology will switch to SFU mode when the _fourth_ participant joins the call. If the current topology is SFU, it will switch to P2P mode when the participant count decreases from &#x60;3&#x60; to &#x60;2&#x60;.  We recommend specifying an integer value for this property except for cases where you would like the room to switch to SFU mode as soon as the first participant joins. In this case, set &#x60;sfu_switchover&#x60; to &#x60;0.5&#x60;.  See our [guide about video call architecture](/guides/architecture-and-monitoring/intro-to-video-arch#the-architecture-of-a-room-p2p-vs-sfu-calls) for additional information. | [optional][default to 2] |
| **experimental_optimize_large_calls** | **Boolean** | Enables Daily Prebuilt to support group calls of up to 1,000 participants and [owner only broadcast](/reference/rest-api/rooms/config#owner_only_broadcast) calls of up to 100K participants.  When set to true, Daily Prebuilt will: - Automatically mute the local user on joining - Update grid view to show a maximum of 12 users in the grid at a time - Allow only 16 users to be unmuted at the same time. When more than 16 users are unmuted, the oldest active speaker will be automatically muted.  See our [guide on large real-time calls](/guides/scaling-calls/large-real-time-calls) for additional instruction.  ⚠️ This flag only applies to Daily Prebuilt. It has no effect when building custom video applications with the Daily call object. | [optional] |
| **lang** | **String** | The default language of the [Daily prebuilt video call UI](/guides/products/prebuilt#daily-prebuilt-ui), for this room.  Setting the language at the room level will override any domain-level language settings you have.  Read more about [changing prebuilt UI language settings](https://help.daily.co/en/articles/4579930-changing-the-language-setting-of-the-prebuilt-ui).  &#x60;*&#x60; Norwegian &#x60;\&quot;no\&quot;&#x60; and Russian &#x60;\&quot;ru\&quot;&#x60; are only available in the new Daily Prebuilt. | [optional][default to &#39;en&#39;] |
| **meeting_join_hook** | **String** | Sets a URL that will receive a webhook when a user joins a room. Default is NULL. Character limit for webhook URL is 255.  More resources: - [Configuring a webhook to send notifications when someone joins your video calls](https://www.daily.co/blog/configure-a-webhook-to-send-notifications-when-someone-joins-your-video-calls/) | [optional] |
| **geo** | **String** | Daily uses signaling servers to manage all of the participants in a given call session. In an SFU/server mode call, the server will send and receive all audio and video from each participant. In a peer-to-peer call, each participant sends media directly to and from each other peer, but a signaling server still manages call state.  Daily runs servers in several different AWS regions to minimize latency for users around the world. The job of &#39;picking&#39; a call server is handled when the first participant joins a room. The first participant&#39;s browser connects to a call server using Amazon&#39;s Route 53 DNS resolution, which chooses a server in the region closest to them.  This isn&#39;t always optimal. For example, if one person joins in London, and then ten more people join from Cape Town, the call will still be hosted out of &#x60;eu-west-2&#x60; . The majority of the participants will have higher latency to the server than if one of them had joined first and the call was being hosted in &#x60;af-south-1&#x60;. In cases like this, you may want to configure your domain (or a specific room) to always choose a call server in a specific AWS region.  Available regions: - &#x60;\&quot;af-south-1\&quot;&#x60; (Cape Town) - &#x60;\&quot;ap-northeast-2\&quot;&#x60; (Seoul) - &#x60;\&quot;ap-southeast-1\&quot;&#x60; (Singapore) - &#x60;\&quot;ap-southeast-2\&quot;&#x60; (Sydney) - &#x60;\&quot;ap-south-1\&quot;&#x60; (Mumbai) - &#x60;\&quot;eu-central-1\&quot;&#x60; (Frankfurt) - &#x60;\&quot;eu-west-2\&quot;&#x60; (London) - &#x60;\&quot;sa-east-1\&quot;&#x60; (São Paulo) - &#x60;\&quot;us-east-1\&quot;&#x60; (N. Virginia) - &#x60;\&quot;us-west-2\&quot;&#x60; (Oregon) | [optional][default to &#39;NULL&#39;] |
| **rtmp_geo** | **String** | Used to select the region where an RTMP stream should originate. In cases where RTMP streaming services aren&#39;t available in the desired region, we&#39;ll attempt to fall back to the default region based on the SFU being used for the meeting.    Available regions:   - &#x60;\&quot;us-west-2\&quot;&#x60; (Oregon)   - &#x60;\&quot;eu-central-1\&quot;&#x60; (Frankfurt)   - &#x60;\&quot;ap-south-1\&quot;&#x60; (Mumbai)    The default regions are grouped based on the SFU region like so:   - RTMP region &#x60;\&quot;us-west-2\&quot;&#x60; includes SFU regions: &#x60;\&quot;us-west-2\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;us-east-1\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;sa-east-1\&quot;&#x60;   - RTMP region &#x60;\&quot;eu-central-1\&quot;&#x60; includes SFU regions: &#x60;\&quot;eu-central-1\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;eu-west-2\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;af-south-1\&quot;&#x60;   - RTMP region &#x60;\&quot;ap-south-1\&quot;&#x60; includes SFU regions: &#x60;\&quot;ap-southeast-1\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;ap-southeast-2\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;ap-northeast-2\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;ap-south-1\&quot;&#x60; | [optional][default to &#39;The closest available region to the SFU region used by the meeting.&#39;] |
| **disable_rtmp_geo_fallback** | **Boolean** | Disable the fall back behavior of rtmp_geo. When rtmp_geo is set, we first try to connect to a media server in desired region. If a media server is not available in the desired region, we fall back to default region based on SFU&#39;s region. This property disables this automatic fall back. When this property is set, we will trigger a recording/streaming error event when media worker is unavailable. Also, the client should retry recording/streaming. | [optional][default to false] |
| **recordings_bucket** | [**RecordingsBucket**](RecordingsBucket.md) |  | [optional] |
| **enable_terse_logging** | **Boolean** | Reduces the volume of log messages. This feature should be enabled when there are more than 200 participants in a meeting to help improve performance.  See our [guides for supporting large experiences](/guides/scaling-calls) for additional instruction. | [optional][default to false] |
| **auto_transcription_settings** | **Object** | Options to use when &#x60;auto_start_transcription&#x60; is true. See [&#x60;startTranscription()&#x60;](/reference/daily-js/instance-methods/start-transcription) for available options. | [optional] |
| **enable_transcription_storage** | **Boolean** | Live transcriptions generated can be saved as WebVTT. This flag controls if transcription started with [&#x60;startTranscription()&#x60;](/reference/daily-js/instance-methods/start-transcription) should be saved or not. | [optional][default to false] |
| **transcription_bucket** | [**TranscriptionBucket**](TranscriptionBucket.md) |  | [optional] |
| **recordings_template** | **String** | Cloud recordings are stored in either Daily&#39;s S3 bucket or the customer&#39;s own S3 bucket. By default recordings are stored as &#x60;{domain_name}/{room_name}/{epoch_time}&#x60;. Sometimes, the use case may call for custom recording file names to be used (for example, if you&#39;d like to enforce the presence of the .mp4 extension in the file name).  &#x60;recordings_template&#x60; is made up of a replacement string with prefixes, suffixes, or both. The currently supported replacements are:   - &#x60;epoch_time&#x60;: The epoch time in seconds (mandatory)   - &#x60;domain_name&#x60;: Your Daily domain (optional)   - &#x60;room_name&#x60;: The name of the room which is getting recorded (optional)   - &#x60;mtg_session_id&#x60;: The ID of the meeting session which is getting recorded (optional)   - &#x60;instance_id&#x60;: The instance ID of the recording (optional)   - &#x60;recording_id&#x60;: The recording ID of the recording (optional)    The restrictions for defining a recording template are as follows:   - The &#x60;epoch_time&#x60; tag is mandatory to ensure the recording file name is unique under all conditions   - The maximum size of the template is 1024 characters   - Each replacement parameter should be placed within a curly bracket (e.g., &#x60;{domain_name}&#x60;)   - Only alphanumeric characters &#x60;(0-9, A-Z, a-z)&#x60; and &#x60;.&#x60;, &#x60;/&#x60;, &#x60;-&#x60;, &#x60;_&#x60; are valid within the template   - &#x60;.mp4&#x60; is the only valid extension  Examples - Example domain: \&quot;myDomain\&quot; - Example room: \&quot;myRoom\&quot;  Example 1: - Template: &#x60;myprefix-{domain_name}-{epoch_time}.mp4&#x60; - Resulting file name: &#x60;myprefix-myDomain-1675842936274.mp4&#x60;  Example 2: - Template: &#x60;{room_name}/{instance_id}/{epoch_time}&#x60; - Resulting room name: &#x60;myRoom/d529cd2f-fbcc-4fb7-b2c0-c4995b1162b6/1675842936274&#x60; | [optional][default to &#39;{domain_name}/{room_name}/{epoch_time}.&#39;] |
| **streaming_endpoints** | [**Array&lt;RoomPropertiesStreamingEndpointsInner&gt;**](RoomPropertiesStreamingEndpointsInner.md) | An array of stream endpoint configuration objects, which allows configurations to be pre-defined without having to pass them into [&#x60;startLiveStreaming()&#x60;](/reference/daily-js/instance-methods/start-live-streaming) at runtime. For example, an RTMP endpoint can be set up for YouTube as a &#x60;streaming_endpoints&#x60; configuration along with another configuration for HLS storage.  HLS output can only be stored on a customer&#39;s S3, not in Daily&#39;s storage infrastructure. The stream configuration defines which S3 bucket to store the HLS output. (See the [S3 bucket guide](/guides/products/live-streaming-recording/storing-recordings-in-a-custom-s3-bucket) for more information.)  Example:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json  {   \&quot;properties\&quot;: {     // ... add additional room properties here     \&quot;streaming_endpoints\&quot;: [       {         \&quot;name\&quot;: \&quot;rtmp_youtube\&quot;,         \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;rtmp\&quot;,         \&quot;rtmp_config\&quot;: {           \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;rtmps://exampleYouTubeServer.com:443/stream\&quot;         }       },        {         \&quot;name\&quot;: \&quot;rtmp_ivs\&quot;,         \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;rtmp\&quot;,         \&quot;rtmp_config\&quot;: {           \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;rtmps://811111111111.global-contribute.live-video.net:443/app/\&quot;         }       },        {         \&quot;name\&quot;: \&quot;hls_akamai\&quot;,         \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;hls\&quot;,         \&quot;hls_config\&quot;: {         \&quot;save_hls_recording\&quot;: true/false,           \&quot;storage\&quot;: {             \&quot;bucket_name\&quot;: \&quot;daily-hls-streams\&quot;,             \&quot;bucket_region\&quot;: \&quot;us-west-2\&quot;,             \&quot;assume_role_arn\&quot;: \&quot;arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/DailyS3AccessRole\&quot;,             \&quot;path_template\&quot;: \&quot;testHarness/{live_streaming_id}/{instance_id}\&quot;           },           \&quot;variant\&quot; : [               {                 \&quot;width\&quot;: 1920,                 \&quot;height\&quot;: 1080,                 \&quot;fps\&quot;: 30,                 \&quot;bitrate\&quot;: 3500,                 \&quot;iframe_only\&quot;: false               },               {                 \&quot;width\&quot;: 1280,                 \&quot;height\&quot;: 720,                 \&quot;fps\&quot;: 30,                 \&quot;bitrate\&quot;: 2500,                 \&quot;iframe_only\&quot;: false               },               {                 \&quot;width\&quot;: 640,                 \&quot;height\&quot;: 360,                 \&quot;fps\&quot;: 30,                 \&quot;bitrate\&quot;: 780,                 \&quot;iframe_only\&quot;: true               }           ]         }       }     ]   } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  To reset the &#x60;streaming_endpoints&#x60; property, pass &#x60;null&#x60; instead of an array.  When calling &#x60;startLiveStreaming()&#x60;, the pre-defined &#x60;streaming_endpoints&#x60; &#x60;name&#x60; can be used:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;javascript await callObject.startLiveStreaming({   endpoints: [{\&quot;endpoint\&quot;:\&quot;rtmp_youtube\&quot;},{\&quot;endpoint\&quot;:\&quot;rtmp_fb\&quot;}],   width: 1280,   height: 720, }); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Properties: | [optional] |
