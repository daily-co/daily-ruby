## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **enable_advanced_chat** | **Boolean** | Property that gives end users a richer chat experience. This includes:  * Emoji reactions to chat messages * Emoji picker in the chat input form * Ability to send a Giphy chat message  ⚠️ This flag only applies to Daily Prebuilt. It has no effect when building custom video applications with the Daily call object. | [optional][default to false] |
| **enable_people_ui** | **Boolean** | Determines if [Daily Prebuilt](/guides/products/prebuilt) displays the People UI. When set to true, a People button in the call tray reveals a People tab in the call sidebar. The tab lists all participants, and next to each name indicates audio status and an option to pin the participant. When &#x60;enable_people_ui&#x60; is set to false, the button and tab are hidden.  ⚠️ Has no effect on custom calls built on the Daily [call object](/guides/products/call-object). | [optional][default to true] |
| **enable_pip_ui** | **Boolean** | Sets whether rooms for this domain can use [Daily Prebuilt](https://www.daily.co/prebuilt)&#39;s Picture in Picture controls. When set to &#x60;true&#x60;, an additional button will be available in Daily Prebuilt&#39;s UI to toggle the Picture in Picture feature.  ⚠️ This flag only applies to Daily Prebuilt. It has no effect when building custom video applications with the Daily call object. | [optional][default to false] |
| **enable_emoji_reactions** | **Boolean** | Determines if [Daily Prebuilt](https://www.daily.co/prebuilt) displays the Emoji Reactions UI.

| **hide_daily_branding** | **Boolean** | Whether \&quot;Powered by Daily\&quot; displays in the in-call UI. | [optional][default to false] |
| **redirect_on_meeting_exit** | **String** | (For meetings that open in a separate browser tab.) When a user clicks on the in-call menu bar&#39;s \&quot;leave meeting\&quot; button, the browser loads this URL. A query string that includes a parameter of the form &#x60;recent-call&#x3D;&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;room&gt;&#x60; is appended to the URL. On mobile, you can redirect to a deep link to bring a user back into your app. | [optional] |
| **hipaa** | **Boolean** | Email us at help@daily.co to turn on HIPAA. Learn more about [our HIPAA compliance](https://www.daily.co/hipaa-compliance). | [optional][default to false] |
| **intercom_auto_record** | **Boolean** | Whether to automatically start recording when an Intercom support agent joins an Intercom-created call. Please see our [Intercom Messenger App page](https://www.daily.co/intercom) for more information.   ⚠️This method is read-only; please contact us if you&#39;d like to enable intercom call auto-recording. | [optional] |
| **lang** | **String** | The default language for the video call UI, for all calls.   If you set the language at this domain level, you can still override the setting for specific rooms in [a room&#39;s configuration properties](/reference/rest-api/rooms/config), or for a specific participant in a [meeting token](/reference/rest-api/meeting-tokens/config).   You can also set the language dynamically using the front-end library [setDailyLang() method](/reference/daily-js/instance-methods/set-daily-lang).  &#x60;*&#x60; Norwegian &#x60;\&quot;no\&quot;&#x60; and Russian &#x60;\&quot;ru\&quot;&#x60; are only available in the new Daily Prebuilt. | [optional][default to &#39;en&#39;] |
| **meeting_join_hook** | **String** | Sets a URL that will receive a webhook when a user joins a room. | [optional][default to &#39;NULL&#39;] |
| **geo** | **String** | Daily uses signaling servers to manage all of the participants in a given call session. In an SFU/server mode call, the server will send and receive all audio and video from each participant. In a peer-to-peer call, each participant sends media directly to and from each other peer, but a signaling server still manages call state.  Daily runs servers in several different AWS regions to minimize latency for users around the world. The job of &#39;picking&#39; a call server is handled when the first participant joins a room. The first participant&#39;s browser connects to a call server using Amazon&#39;s Route 53 DNS resolution, which chooses a server in the region closest to them.  This isn&#39;t always optimal. For example, if one person joins in London, and then ten more people join from Cape Town, the call will still be hosted out of &#x60;eu-west-2&#x60; . The majority of the participants will have higher latency to the server than if one of them had joined first and the call was being hosted in &#x60;af-south-1&#x60;. In cases like this, you may want to configure your domain (or a specific room) to always choose a call server in a specific AWS region.  Available regions: - &#x60;\&quot;af-south-1\&quot;&#x60; (Cape Town) - &#x60;\&quot;ap-northeast-2\&quot;&#x60; (Seoul) - &#x60;\&quot;ap-southeast-1\&quot;&#x60; (Singapore) - &#x60;\&quot;ap-southeast-2\&quot;&#x60; (Sydney) - &#x60;\&quot;ap-south-1\&quot;&#x60; (Mumbai) - &#x60;\&quot;eu-central-1\&quot;&#x60; (Frankfurt) - &#x60;\&quot;eu-west-2\&quot;&#x60; (London) - &#x60;\&quot;sa-east-1\&quot;&#x60; (São Paulo) - &#x60;\&quot;us-east-1\&quot;&#x60; (N. Virginia) - &#x60;\&quot;us-west-2\&quot;&#x60; (Oregon) | [optional][default to &#39;NULL&#39;] |
| **rtmp_geo** | **String** | Used to select the region where an RTMP stream should originate. In cases where RTMP streaming services aren&#39;t available in the desired region, we&#39;ll attempt to fall back to the default region based on the SFU being used for the meeting.    Available regions:   - &#x60;\&quot;us-west-2\&quot;&#x60; (Oregon)   - &#x60;\&quot;eu-central-1\&quot;&#x60; (Frankfurt)   - &#x60;\&quot;ap-south-1\&quot;&#x60; (Mumbai)    The default regions are grouped based on the SFU region like so:   - RTMP region &#x60;\&quot;us-west-2\&quot;&#x60; includes SFU regions: &#x60;\&quot;us-west-2\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;us-east-1\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;sa-east-1\&quot;&#x60;   - RTMP region &#x60;\&quot;eu-central-1\&quot;&#x60; includes SFU regions: &#x60;\&quot;eu-central-1\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;eu-west-2\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;af-south-1\&quot;&#x60;   - RTMP region &#x60;\&quot;ap-south-1\&quot;&#x60; includes SFU regions: &#x60;\&quot;ap-southeast-1\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;ap-southeast-2\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;ap-northeast-2\&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;\&quot;ap-south-1\&quot;&#x60; | [optional][default to &#39;The closest available region to the SFU region used by the meeting.&#39;] |
| **disable_rtmp_geo_fallback** | **Boolean** | Disable the fall back behavior of rtmp_geo. When rtmp_geo is set, we first try to connect to a media server in desired region. If a media server is not available in the desired region, we fall back to default region based on SFU&#39;s region. This property disables this automatic fall back. When this property is set, we will trigger a recording/streaming error event when media worker is unavailable. Also, the client should retry recording/streaming. | [optional][default to false] |
| **enable_terse_logging** | **Boolean** | Reduces the volume of log messages. This feature should be enabled when there are more than 200 participants in a meeting to help improve performance.  See our [guides for supporting large experiences](/guides/scaling-calls) for additional instruction. | [optional][default to false] |
| **enable_transcription_storage** | **Boolean** | Live transcriptions generated can be saved as WebVTT. This flag controls if transcription started with [&#x60;startTranscription()&#x60;](/reference/daily-js/instance-methods/start-transcription) should be saved or not. | [optional][default to false] |
| **transcription_bucket** | [**TranscriptionBucket**](TranscriptionBucket.md) |  | [optional] |
| **recordings_template** | **String** | Cloud recordings are stored in either Daily&#39;s S3 bucket or the customer&#39;s own S3 bucket. By default recordings are stored as &#x60;{domain_name}/{room_name}/{epoch_time}&#x60;. Sometimes, the use case may call for custom recording file names to be used (for example, if you&#39;d like to enforce the presence of the .mp4 extension in the file name).  &#x60;recordings_template&#x60; is made up of a replacement string with prefixes, suffixes, or both. The currently supported replacements are:   - &#x60;epoch_time&#x60;: The epoch time in seconds (mandatory)   - &#x60;domain_name&#x60;: Your Daily domain (optional)   - &#x60;room_name&#x60;: The name of the room which is getting recorded (optional)   - &#x60;mtg_session_id&#x60;: The ID of the meeting session which is getting recorded (optional)   - &#x60;instance_id&#x60;: The instance ID of the recording (optional)   - &#x60;recording_id&#x60;: The recording ID of the recording (optional)    The restrictions for defining a recording template are as follows:   - The &#x60;epoch_time&#x60; tag is mandatory to ensure the recording file name is unique under all conditions   - The maximum size of the template is 1024 characters   - Each replacement parameter should be placed within a curly bracket (e.g., &#x60;{domain_name}&#x60;)   - Only alphanumeric characters &#x60;(0-9, A-Z, a-z)&#x60; and &#x60;.&#x60;, &#x60;/&#x60;, &#x60;-&#x60;, &#x60;_&#x60; are valid within the template   - &#x60;.mp4&#x60; is the only valid extension  Examples - Example domain: \&quot;myDomain\&quot; - Example room: \&quot;myRoom\&quot;  Example 1: - Template: &#x60;myprefix-{domain_name}-{epoch_time}.mp4&#x60; - Resulting file name: &#x60;myprefix-myDomain-1675842936274.mp4&#x60;  Example 2: - Template: &#x60;{room_name}/{instance_id}/{epoch_time}&#x60; - Resulting room name: &#x60;myRoom/d529cd2f-fbcc-4fb7-b2c0-c4995b1162b6/1675842936274&#x60; | [optional][default to &#39;{domain_name}/{room_name}/{epoch_time}.&#39;] |
| **enable_mesh_sfu** | **Boolean** | Configures a room to use multiple SFUs for a call&#39;s media. This feature enables calls to scale to large sizes and to reduce latency between participants. It is recommended specifically for interactive live streaming.  See our [guide for interactive live streaming](/guides/scaling-calls/interactive-live-streaming-rtmp-output#daily-prebuilt-configurations-to-support-100-000-participants) for additional instruction. | [optional] |
| **sfu_switchover** | **Float** | Dictates the participant count after which room topology automatically switches from Peer-to-Peer (P2P) to Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) mode, or vice versa.  For example, if &#x60;sfu_switchover&#x60; is set to &#x60;3&#x60; and the current network topology is P2P, the topology will switch to SFU mode when the _fourth_ participant joins the call. If the current topology is SFU, it will switch to P2P mode when the participant count decreases from &#x60;3&#x60; to &#x60;2&#x60;.  We recommend specifying an integer value for this property except for cases where you would like the room to switch to SFU mode as soon as the first participant joins. In this case, set &#x60;sfu_switchover&#x60; to &#x60;0.5&#x60;.  See our [guide about video call architecture](/guides/architecture-and-monitoring/intro-to-video-arch#the-architecture-of-a-room-p2p-vs-sfu-calls) for additional information. | [optional][default to 2] |
| **recordings_bucket** | [**RecordingsBucket**](RecordingsBucket.md) |  | [optional] |
| **permissions** | [**Permissions**](Permissions.md) |  | [optional] |
| **batch_processor_bucket** | **Object** | Defines a custom S3 bucket where the batch processor will write its output | [optional] |
| **batch_processor_enable_medical_concept** | **Boolean** | Enables whether the batch processor will use [ScienceIO metadata concepts](https://www.science.io/) when generating SOAP notes. | [optional][default to true] |
